Manuevers Needed (some of these will be "team-wide" and some can be "individual") - these are more complicated than complex actions in that they require timing and orientation outside of single-hero scope:

- team_spread_out (to avoid AOE's like Lich's Ult, Faceless Chronosphere, etc)
- team_collapse (to cluster - not sure why, except perhaps inside Roshan pit)
- solo_flank (for in-lane harassment/zoning by supports against specific enemy hero)
- solo_juke (retreating into trees and losing enemies sight of us)
- team_bait (for baiting attacks by enemy)
- solo_roam (this is a manuever that takes us through enemy areas of interest - like jungle, bounty runes, between T1 & T2 towers to try and courier snipe, etc)
